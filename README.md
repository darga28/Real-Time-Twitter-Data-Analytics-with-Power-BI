# **Real-Time Twitter Data Analytics with Power BI**

## **Overview**
This project utilizes Power BI to analyze real-time Twitter data, delivering actionable insights into tweet performance, user engagement, and interaction trends. The dashboard includes advanced features like dynamic filtering and forecasting to enhance the depth and accuracy of the analysis.

## **Objective**
To develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides key metrics and trends from Twitter data, enabling users to make data-driven decisions and forecast future engagement.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Imported and cleaned the raw dataset (`Twitter_data.csv`) using Power Query.
   - Created custom columns for essential metrics and transformations such as engagement rates, time-based filters, and specific conditions for data analysis.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Applied filters based on specific time periods and engagement metrics.
   - Built calculated columns and measures to enhance the insights from the data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Designed an interactive dashboard with diverse visualizations including bar charts, scatter plots, and a line chart for "Engagement Trend Over Time (Monthly Breakdown)" with forecasting.
   - Enabled filters on specific visuals to show relevant data for distinct time periods.

4. **Dashboard Optimization**:
   - Ensured the dashboard is user-friendly and visually appealing with clear, actionable insights.

## **Analysis & Insights**
- **Top Engagement Tweets**: Identifies tweets with the highest engagement rates and combined retweets/likes.
- **Interaction Breakdown by Tweet Category**: Shows URL clicks, profile clicks, and hashtag interactions across different tweet types.
- **Media Engagements vs. Media Views**: Analyzes the correlation between media engagements and views.
- **Engagement Trend Over Time**: Features forecasting for future engagement trends.
- **Day-wise Media Interactions**: Examines media views and engagements by day of the week during the last quarter.
- **App Opens vs. No App Opens**: Compares engagement rates for tweets with and without app opens.

## **Key Findings**
- Tweets with media and shorter word counts generally receive higher engagement.
- Specific time periods, particularly afternoons on weekdays, show increased user interaction.
- Forecasting provides predictive insights, aiding in proactive decision-making.
- Dynamic filters enable focused analysis, enhancing usability.

## **Files Included**
- **`Twitter(X)_Dashboard.pbix`**: The Power BI file with the completed dashboard, including visuals, measures, and transformations.
- **`Twitter_data.csv`**: The source dataset used for the analysis.
